# deadchatxd
dead chat xd is a Discord bot that will send a "dead chat xd" meme gif if a channel is inactive for a certain amount of time.

## Using the bot
Make sure the bot has Embed Links permissions, otherwise it will not be able to embed gifs.

### Commands
The enable, disable, and edit commands require you to have Manage Channels permissions to use.

- `@dead chat xd help` - Outputs the help message, which shows a list of commands and info about the bot.
- `@dead chat xd query` - Tells you if dead chat xd is enabled in this channel; and if it is, how long the timer is.
- `@dead chat xd enable <time>` - Enables dead chat xd in this channel. You must replace <time> with the amount of time this channel should be inactive for the bot to activate. For example, `enable 2m` will activate the bot if no messages are sent for 2 minutes. Use the letters s, m, h, and d to specify seconds, minutes, hours, and days.
- `@dead chat xd disable` - Disables dead chat xd in this channel.
- `@dead chat xd edit <time>` - Use this to edit the timer for this channel. Same instructions as the enable command.
  
### GIFs
Once the timer goes off and the bot activates, it will send one of the following gifs:
